# FineZoom

**FineZoom** is a lightweight addon for **World of Warcraft Vanilla / Turtle WoW** that provides precise and smooth camera zoom control using custom zoom steps.

Due to engine limitations in Vanilla, FineZoom works by offering configurable zoom actions instead of modifying the native mouse wheel behavior. This ensures maximum compatibility and stability while preserving the original feel of the game.

- Fully compatible with Vanilla and Turtle WoW

## 📦 Installation

2. Place the `FineZoom` folder into:

## 🧠 Notes

Vanilla WoW does not expose a global zoom speed variable.  
For this reason, FineZoom uses custom zoom bindings to achieve finer control in a safe and compatible way.
